    text: "I decided it was time to change my job and find out what it's like to work in another company. So I joined a team in Raiffeisen Bank and started working on some internal products for managers. Our solutions helped (and still do) them to do budget distribution, increase employees salaries and divide bonuses between teammates. I have integrated Redux to our apps which was quite useful. Also we completely redesigned our salary increasing and bonuses dividing apps and created a handy admin tools. All this helped us to flexibly set up and launch the 2022 processes. We received a lot of positive feedback from users, so we were very happy :)",

I started developing a React components library and made a new web app with React, Redux and TypeScript. There was also a big back-end refactoring task I was responsible for, and that was a knotty problem. I had to not only rewrite but also scale the solution and deal with highload. And I managed it!",
